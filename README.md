# Object-Detection

[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

There are 4 .py files and 1 .pynb files in the project. 

1.	label.py is the file that I label my training set. 
2.	param.py is the file that I compute different classesâ€™ mean and covariance. 
3.	Gaussian.py is my test code about the segmentation part and it will load the parameters from param.py.
4.	bounding_box.py is my test code about the bounding box part and it will load the saved mask_img from Gaussian.py.
5.	barrel_dector.py is the file that I submitted to autograder, it is the combination and some modification of Gaussian.py and bounding_box.py.
